## Introduction

The Most central topic of architecting a Flutter [(Flutter Dev Team 2018g)](https://flutter.dev/) app is *Statemanagement* [(Flutter Dev Team 2019b)](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt). **Where** does my State sit, **who** need access to it and **how** do parts of the app access it? This chapter aims to answer those questions. You will learn about the two types of state, you will be introduced to the most 4 most popular Statemanagement solutions and you will learn one of those Statemanagement solutions (BLoC [(Soares 2018)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLHln7wHgPE)) in detail.

## Types of State

The Flutter documentaion [(Flutter Dev Team 2019b)](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt) differentiates between two types of State: *Ephemeral State* & *App State*.
Ephemeral State is State that is only required in one location IE inside of one Widget. Examples would be: scroll position in a list, highlighting of selected elements or the color change of a pressed button. This is the type of state that we donâ€™t need to worry about that much or in other word, there is no need for a fancy Statemanagement solution for Ephemeral State. We can simply use a Stateful Widget with some variables and manage Ephemeral State that way [(Flutter Dev Team 2019b)](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt). The more interesting type of State is App State. This is information that is required in multiple locations / by multiple Widgets. Examples would be: User data, a list of favorites or a shopping car. App State management is going to be the focus of this chapter.
