## Introduction

This Chapter will give you a basic understanding of how the Flutter Framework [\[1\]](https://flutter.dev/) works as a whole. I will showcase the difference of Flutter to other Cross-Platform approaches and how Flutter works [*under the hood*](https://github.com/Fasust/flutter-guide/wiki/110-Under-the-Hood). You will also be introduced to the concepts of [*State*](https://github.com/Fasust/flutter-guide/wiki/120-Thinking-Declaratively) [\[12\]](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt) and Flutterâ€™s way of rendering an app as a [tree of *Widgets*](https://github.com/Fasust/flutter-guide/wiki/130-The-Widget-Tree) [\[13\]](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatefulWidget-class.html). Lastly, you will gain an understanding of how Flutter handles [Asynchronous Programming](https://github.com/Fasust/flutter-guide/wiki/140-Asynchronous-Flutter) and communication with the Web.
