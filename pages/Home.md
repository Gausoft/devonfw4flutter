## The Goal of this Guide

This guide aims to bridge the gap between the absolute Flutter [\[1\]](https://flutter.dev/) basics and clean, structured Flutter development. It should bring you from the basics of knowing how to build an app with Flutter to an understanding of how to do it *properly*. Or at least show you one possible way to make large scale Flutter projects clean and manageable.

## Who is this Guide for?

For people with a basic knowledge of the Flutter Framework. I recommend following this tutorial by the Flutter team [\[2\]](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab). It will walk you through developing your first Flutter application. You should also have a basic understanding of the Dart programming language [\[3\]](https://dart.dev/). No worries, it is very similar to Java [\[4\]](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html), Kotlin [\[5\]](https://kotlinlang.org/) and JavaScript [\[6\]](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm). So if you know 1 or 2 of those languages you should be fine.

## Topics that will be covered

  - A brief introduction to the Flutter Framework in general. How it works *under the hood* and its underlying structure.
  - One possible architecture for your Flutter app and how to implement it (BLoC [\[7\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLHln7wHgPE))
  - How to test your app
  - Some conventions and best practices for Dart, BLoC and the Flutter Framework
  - My personal opinion of the framework

## Creation Context

This guide was written by a student in the Bachelor of Science Program ‚ÄúComputer Science and Media Technology‚Äù at Technical University Cologne [\[8\]](https://www.th-koeln.de/en/homepage_26.php), and it was created for one of the modules in that Bachelor. In addition to this, the guide was written in collaboration with Capgemini Cologne [\[9\]](https://www.capgemini.com/us-en/). Capgemini released a guide on building an application in Angular [\[10\]](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4ng) in May of 2019, this guide is meant to be the Flutter version of that.

## Structure

The guide is designed to be read in order, from Chapter 0 (this one) to Chapter 5. Code examples throughout the chapters will mainly be taken from Wisgen [\[11\]](https://github.com/Fasust/wisgen), an example Flutter Application that was specifically built for the purposes of this guide. There is going to be a few common symbols throughout the guide, this is what they stand for:

| Symbol | Meaning                  |
| :----: | :----------------------- |
|   üìô    | Definition               |
|   üïê    | Shortened version (TLDR) |
|   ‚ö†    | Important                |

## My Sources

I am basing this guide on a combination of conference talks, blog articles by respected Flutter developers, the official documentation, scientific papers that cover cross-platform mobile development in general and many other sources. All sources used in the guide are listed in the chapter [*References*](https://github.com/Fasust/flutter-guide/wiki/600-References). To better understand all the theory, I also developed the Wisgen app [\[11\]](https://github.com/Fasust/wisgen) using the Flutter Framework and the BLoC Pattern [\[7\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLHln7wHgPE).
