## Introduction

//Last Snip 48
//Last Fig 28

So, you’ve made it. This is the final chapter of the guide. I will use this chapter ro reflect on the Guide, evaluate it’s strengths and weaknesses, and highlight how I and this project will move foreword from here on out. I will also take this opportunity to share my personal opinion of the Flutter Framework [\[1\]](https://flutter.dev/). That being said, the guide has already been quite opinionated up until now.

## Evaluation of the Guide

I am pretty happy with how the Guide turned out. I managed to find a diverse range of sources for most of the topics I wanted to cover. I kept close to the *informal*, *from developer for developer*-style of the original Angular guide [\[2\]](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4ng) and I think it reads pretty well. The Guide did end up being a bit longer then I planned (\~50 A4 Pages without figures and references). If I would write it again, I would choose a more narrow and clear scope for what the guide should include. For example, I might have excluded or shortened chapter [1 The Flutter Framework](https://github.com/Fasust/flutter-guide/wiki/100-The-Flutter-Framework) and instead focused even more on chapter [2 Architecting a Flutter App](https://github.com/Fasust/flutter-guide/wiki/200-Architecting-a-Flutter-App). I would have also liked to include more scientific sources on Flutter. But as it is still such a new Framework, next to no scientific research has so far been conducted on it. As of the writing of this Guide their is not a single paper published on the Flutter Framework though IEEE [\[3\]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp) or ACM [\[4\]](https://dl.acm.org/).

All in all, I think I fulfilled the goal I set myself when when starting this guide. To bridge the gap between the basics of FLutter and clean, structured Flutter development. The result is a resource I would have liked to have when trying to bridge that gap myself.

## Future of the Guide and Next Steps

This Guide was commissioned by Capgemini Cologne [\[5\]](https://www.capgemini.com/us-en/). It is supposed to introduce their mobile developer to the Flutter Framework and help them evaluate if it is a valid option for future projects. It will also be the basis for my Bachelor Thesis I am starting this November. In my thesis I will create and document a large scale Flutter application for Capgemini. It is supposed to be an example project that other developers can use as a guideline for creating their own large scale Flutter applications. More specifically, Capgemini has used the “My Thai Star” App [\[6\]](https://github.com/devonfw/my-thai-star) as a reference for Angular [\[7\]](https://angular.io/). I will create a Flutter version of it.

### Suggestion for Future Works

One thing I and peers in the mobile development community [\[8\]](http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3241739) would like to see is more scientific research on the Flutter Framework: Lagre scale benchmarking, usability tests, saleability tests, architecture evaluation and so on.

## My Thoughts on Flutter

  - positive
      - very efficient and smooth rendering
          - unlike other cross-plattform solutions
      - was not a fan of state handeling at the beginning
          - now with bloc I am
          - necessary for efficacy
      - Great community
      - Flutter Team involves and listens to the community
  - negative
      - ugly code
      - injection requires interface dependency

All in all. I wont be doing native dev again any time soon.
