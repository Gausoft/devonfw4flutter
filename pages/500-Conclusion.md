## Introduction

//Last Snip 48
//Last Fig 28

So, you’ve made it. This is the final chapter of the guide. I will use this chapter ro reflect on the Guide, evaluate it’s strengths and weaknesses, and highlight how I and this project will move foreword from here on out. I will also take this opportunity to share my personal opinion of the framework (that being said, the guide has already been quite opinionated up until now).

## Evaluation of the Guide

  - what I like
      - Diverse sources
      - many sources
      - What I would have wanted when starting out
      - personal/ informal style
      - Clear guid-line on how to build a project
      - BLoC chapter
  - Where are the short comings of the guide?
      - Wordy
      - could have been more narrowed down
      - scope was ill defined
      - more Scientific papers as sources (if there where any)

## Next Steps

  - Find some use within Capgemini
  - Bachelor Thesis
      - Example Project Large Scale
      - Building on the knowledge I obtained fro writing this
  - Scientific research on topic (same as Tor paper) [\[89\]](http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3241739)

## My Thought on Flutter

  - positive
      - very efficient and smooth rendering
          - unlike other cross-plattform solutions
      - was not a fan of state handeling at the beginning
          - now with bloc I am
          - necessary for efficacy
      - Great community
      - Flutter Team involves and listens to the community
  - negative
      - ugly code
      - injection requires interface dependency

All in all. I wont be doing native dev again any time soon.
