- Dart has own guide
- this is a summarie
  - focus on things that are unique to dart (Java, Javascript, C)
- "A surprisingly important part of good code is good style. Consistent naming, ordering, and formatting helps code that is the same look the same."

## Naming conventions
- Table
- Last word should be the most descriptive one (pageCount, wisdomSink)

## Comments

## Strings
- ${year + day}

## Bracket Hell 
- Own widgets (performance)
- Callback functions

## File structure with BLoC
- no consensus, I would recommend a folder / layer + models
