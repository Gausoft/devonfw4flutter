Testing has become an essential part of developing a large scale application and there is strong evidence that writing tests leads to a higher code quality [[@georgeInitialInvestigationTest2003]](http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/952532.952753). This chapter aims to give you a brief introduction to how testing in Flutter [[@flutterdevteamFlutterFramework2018]](https://flutter.dev/) works and more specifically, how to test an app that implements the BLoC Pattern [[@soaresFlutterAngularDartCode2018]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLHln7wHgPE).

## Types of Tests in Flutter
Flutters official test library [[@dartteamTestDartPackage2019]](https://pub.dev/packages/test) differentiates between three types of tests:

#### Unit Tests 
Unit Test can be run very quickly. They can test any function of your app, that does not require the rendering of a Widget [[@hracekTestingFlutterApps2019]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bj-oMYyLZEY&). Their main use-case is to test business logic or in our case: BLoCs [[@soaresFlutterAngularDartCode2018]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLHln7wHgPE).

#### Widget Tests
Widget Tests are used to test small Widget Sub-Trees of your application. They run relatively quickly and can test the behavior of a given UI [[@hracekTestingFlutterApps2019]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bj-oMYyLZEY&).

#### Integration Test (Driver Tests)
Integration Test/Driver Tests run your entire application in a virtual machine or on a physical device. They can test user-journeys and complete use-cases. They are very slow and _"prone to braking"_[[@hracekTestingFlutterApps2019]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bj-oMYyLZEY&).

## Writing Unit Tests
I will focus on _Unit Tests_ for this guide. The Flutter Team recommends that the majority of Flutter tests should be Unit Test [@hracekTestingFlutterApps2019; @flutterdevteamTestingFlutterApps2018]. This is because the fact that they are quick to write and quick to execute makes up for their relatively low _confidence_. In addition to this, because we are using the BLoC Pattern, our UI shouldn't contain that much testable code anyways. Or to paraphrase the BLoC pattern creator: We keep our UI so _stupid_ we don't need to test it [[@soaresFlutterAngularDartCode2018]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLHln7wHgPE). First we have to import the test library [[@dartteamTestDartPackage2019]](https://pub.dev/packages/test) and the mockito package [[@fibulwinterMockitoDartPackage2019]](https://pub.dev/packages/mockito) in our _pubspec.yaml_:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  mockito: ^4.1.1
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
```
_Code Snippet XXX: Pubspec.yaml Test Imports_

_flutter\_test_ offers the core testing capabilities of Flutter, _mockito_ is used to mock up dependencies. Now place a new directory called _"tests"_ on the root level of our app directory:

![Wisgen Test Directory](https://github.com/Fasust/flutter-guide/wiki//images/wisgen-test-dir.PNG)

_Figure XXX: Wisgen Test Directory [[@faustWisgen2019]](https://github.com/Fasust/wisgen)_

| âš    | All testfiles have to end with the postfix "_test.dart" to be recognized by the framework [[@hracekTestingFlutterApps2019]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bj-oMYyLZEY&). |
| --- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

Now we can start writing our tests. For this example, I will test the favortie BLoC of Wisgen [[@faustWisgen2019]](https://github.com/Fasust/wisgen):
```dart
void main() {

  ///Related test are grouped together 
  ///to get a more readable output 
  group('Favorite Bloc', () {
    FavoriteBloc favoriteBloc;

    setUp((){
      //Run before each test
      favoriteBloc = new FavoriteBloc();
    });

    tearDown((){
      //Run after each test
      favoriteBloc.dispose();
    });
    
    test('Initial State is an empty list', () {
      expect(favoriteBloc.currentState, List());
    });

    ...
  });
}
```
_Code Snippet XXX: Wisgen Favorite BLoC Tests 1 [[@faustWisgen2019]](https://github.com/Fasust/wisgen)_

We can use the _group()_ function to group realted tests together. This way the output if our tests is more neatly formated [[@hracekTestingFlutterApps2019]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bj-oMYyLZEY&). _setUp()_ is called once before every test, so it is perfect for initializing our BLoC [[@angelovUnitTestingBloc2019]](https://medium.com/flutter-community/unit-testing-with-bloc-b94de9655d86). _tearDown()_ is called after every test, so we can use it to dispose our BLoC. The _test()_ function takes in a name and a callback with the test. In our test, we check if the state of the favorite BloC after initalization is an empty list. _expect()_ takes in the actual value and the value that is expected: `expect(actual, matcher)`. 

### Testing Streams
Now a more relevant topic when working with the BLoC Pattern, the testing of Streams [[@dartteamDartStreams2019]](https://dart.dev/tutorials/language/streams):

```dart
void main() {

  group('Favorite Bloc', () {
    FavoriteBloc favoriteBloc;

    setUp((){...});

    tearDown((){...});
    
    
    test('Initial State is an empty list', () {...});

    test('Stream many events and see if the State is emitted in correct order', () {
      //Set Up
      Wisdom wisdom1 = Wisdom(id: 1, text: "Back up your Pictures", type: "tech");
      Wisdom wisdom2 = Wisdom(id: 2, text: "Wash your ears", type: "Mum's Advice");
      Wisdom wisdom3 = Wisdom(id: 3, text: "Travel while you're young", type: "Grandma's Advice");

      //Testing
      favoriteBloc.dispatch(AddFavoriteEvent(wisdom1));
      favoriteBloc.dispatch(AddFavoriteEvent(wisdom2));
      favoriteBloc.dispatch(RemoveFavoriteEvent(wisdom1));
      favoriteBloc.dispatch(AddFavoriteEvent(wisdom3));

      //Result
      expect( 
          favoriteBloc.state,
          emitsInOrder([
            List(), //BLoC Library BLoCs emit their initial State on creation
            List()..add(wisdom1),
            List()..add(wisdom1)..add(wisdom2),
            List()..add(wisdom2),
            List()..add(wisdom2)..add(wisdom3)
          ]));
    });
  });
}
```
_Code Snippet XXX: Wisgen Favorite BLoC Tests 2 [[@faustWisgen2019]](https://github.com/Fasust/wisgen)_

In this test, we create three wisdoms and add/remove them from the favorite BLoC by sending the corresponding events. We then wrap our _matcher_ in the _emitsInOrder()_ function. This tells the framework that we are working with a stream and looking for specific set of events to be emitted in order [[@angelovUnitTestingBloc2019]](https://medium.com/flutter-community/unit-testing-with-bloc-b94de9655d86).

### Mockito

```dart
void main() {
  group('Wisdom Bloc', () {
    WisdomBloc wisdomBloc;
    MockRepository mockRepository;
    MockBuildContext mockBuildContext;

    setUp(() {
      wisdomBloc = WisdomBloc();
      mockRepository = MockRepository();
      mockBuildContext = MockBuildContext();

      wisdomBloc.repository = mockRepository;
    });

    tearDown(() {
      //Run after each test
      wisdomBloc.dispose();
    });

    test('Send Fetch Event and see if it emits correct wisdom', () {
      List<Wisdom> fetchedWisdom = [
        Wisdom(id: 1, text: "Back up your Pictures", type: "tech"),
        Wisdom(id: 2, text: "Wash your ears", type: "Mum's Advice"),
        Wisdom(id: 3, text: "Travel while you're young", type: "Grandma's Advice")
      ];

      List expectedStates = [
        //BLoC Library BLoCs emit their initial State on creation
        IdleWisdomState(new List()), 
        IdleWisdomState(fetchedWisdom)
      ];

      when(mockRepository.fetch(20, mockBuildContext))
          .thenAnswer((_) async => fetchedWisdom);

      expectLater(wisdomBloc.state, emitsInOrder(expectedStates));

      wisdomBloc.dispatch(FetchEvent(mockBuildContext));
    });
  });
}
```
_Code Snippet XXX: Wisgen Wisdom BLoC Tests with Mockito [[@faustWisgen2019]](https://github.com/Fasust/wisgen)_

```dart
///The Wisdom BLoC has 2 States: Loaded and Error
///We can infer it is loading when we are not reviving new items through the stream
@immutable
abstract class WisdomState extends Equatable {}

///Broadcasted on Network Error
class ErrorWisdomState extends WisdomState {
  final Exception exception;
  ErrorWisdomState(this.exception);

  @override
  List<Object> get props => [exception];
}

///Normal State that holds favorite list.
///When BLoC receives a FetchEvent during this State, 
///it fetches more wisdom and emits a new IdleWisdomState 
///with more wisdoms
class IdleWisdomState extends WisdomState {
  final List<Wisdom> wisdoms;
  IdleWisdomState(this.wisdoms);

  @override
  List<Object> get props => wisdoms;
}
