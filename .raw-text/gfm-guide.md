# 400-Conventions

## Introduction

//Last Fig 25
//Last Snip 42

  - Dart has own guide
  - this is a summarie
      - focus on things that are unique to dart (Java, Javascript, C)
  - “A surprisingly important part of good code is good style. Consistent naming, ordering, and formatting helps code that is the same look the same.”

## Naming conventions

  - Table \[1\]
  - Last word should be the most descriptive one (pageCount, wisdomSink)

## Comments

## Strings

  - ${year + day}

## Bracket Hell

  - Own widgets (performance)
  - Callback functions

## File structure with BLoC

  - no consensus, I would recommend a folder / layer + models
  - ui into pages and widgets
