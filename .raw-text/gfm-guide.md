# 500-Conclusion

## Introduction

//Last Snip 48

So, you’ve made it. This is the final chapter of the guide. I will use this chapter ro reflect on the Guide, evaluate it’s strengths and weaknesses, and highlight how I and this project will move foreword from here on out. I will also take this opportunity to share my personal opinion of the Flutter Framework [(Flutter Dev Team 2018)](https://flutter.dev/) (that being said, the guide has already been quite opinionated up until now).

## Evaluation of the Guide

I am pretty happy with how the Guide turned out. I managed to find a diverse range of sources for most of the topics I wanted to cover. I kept close to the *informal*, *from developer for developer*-style of the original Angular guide [(Ambuludi, Linares, and Contributors 2019)](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4ng) and I think it reads pretty well. The Guide did end up being a bit longer then I planned (\~50 A4 Pages without figures and references). If I would write it again, I would choose a more narrow and clear scope for what the guide should include. For example, I might have excluded or shortened chapter \[1 The Flutter Framework\]\[framework\] and instead focused even more on chapter \[2 Architecting a Flutter App\]\[architecture\]. I would have also liked to include more scientific sources on Flutter. But as it is still such a new Framework, next to no scientific research has so far been conducted on it. As of the writing of this Guide their is not a single paper published on the Flutter Framework though IEEE [(IEEE 1963)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp) or ACM [(ACM 1947)](https://dl.acm.org/).

All in all, I think I fulfilled the goal I set myself when when starting this guide. To bridge the gap between the basics of FLutter and clean, structured Flutter development. The result is a resource I would have liked to have when trying to bridge that gap myself.

## Next Steps

  - Find some use within Capgemini
  - Bachelor Thesis
      - Example Project Large Scale
      - Building on the knowledge I obtained fro writing this
  - Scientific research on topic (same as Tor paper) [(Biørn-Hansen, Grønli, and Ghinea 2018)](http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3241739)

## My Thoughts on Flutter

  - positive
      - very efficient and smooth rendering
          - unlike other cross-plattform solutions
      - was not a fan of state handeling at the beginning
          - now with bloc I am
          - necessary for efficacy
      - Great community
      - Flutter Team involves and listens to the community
  - negative
      - ugly code
      - injection requires interface dependency

All in all. I wont be doing native dev again any time soon.
