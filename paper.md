## The Goal of this Guide

This guide aims to bridge the gap between the absolute Flutter (Flutter
Dev Team 2018a) basics and clean, structured Flutter development. It
should bring you from the basics of knowing how to build an app with
Flutter to an understanding of how to do it *properly*. Or at least show
you one possible way to make large scale Flutter projects clean and
manageable.

## Who is this Guide for?

For people with a basic knowledge of the Flutter Framework. I recommend
following this Flutter team (Flutter Dev Team 2018b). It will walk you
through developing your first flutter application. You should also have
a basic understanding of the Dart programming language (Dart Team
2019a). No worries, it is very similar to [Java
(Oracle 1996)](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html),
[Kotlin (Jet Brains 2017)](https://kotlinlang.org/) and [JavaScript
(ECMA 1997)](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm).
So if you know 1 or 2 of those languages you should be fine. Lastly, for
the Architecture chapter, you should have a basic understanding of [Data
Streams (Dart Team 2019b)](https://dart.dev/tutorials/language/streams).

## Topics that will be covered

  - A brief introduction to the Flutter Framework in general. How it
    works *under the hood* and its underlying structure.
  - One possible architecture for your Flutter app and how to implement
    it ([BLoC
    (Soares 2018)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLHln7wHgPE))
  - How to test your app
  - Some conventions and best practices for Dart, BLoC and the Flutter
    Framework
  - My personal opinion of the framework
