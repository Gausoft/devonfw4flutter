## Introduction
This Chapter will give you a basic understanding of how the [Flutter Framework](https://flutter.dev/) works as a whole. I will showcase the difference of Flutter to other Cross-Platform approaches and how Flutter works _under the hood_. You will also be introduced to the concepts of [_state_](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt) and flutters way of rendering an app as a tree of _widgets_.
