  abstract = {Cloud computing is an emerging computing paradigm. It aims to share data, calculations, and services transparently among users of a massive grid. Although the industry has started selling cloud-computing products, research challenges in various areas, such as UI design, task decomposition, task distribution, and task coordination, are still unclear. Therefore, we study the methods to reason and model cloud computing as a step toward identifying fundamental research questions in this paradigm. In this paper, we compare cloud computing with service computing and pervasive computing. Both the industry and research community have actively examined these three computing paradigms. We draw a qualitative comparison among them based on the classic model of computer architecture. We finally evaluate the comparison results and draw up a series of research questions in cloud computing for future exploration.},

  abstract = {The Web of Things is an active research ﬁeld which aims at promoting the easy access and handling of smart things’ digital representations through the adoption of Web standards and technologies. While huge research and development efforts have been spent on lower level networks and software technologies, it has been recognized that little experience exists instead in modeling and building applications for the Web of Things. Although several works have proposed Representational State Transfer (REST) inspired approaches for the Web of Things, a main limitation is that poor support is provided to web developers for speeding up the development of Web of Things applications while taking full advantage of REST beneﬁts. In this paper, we propose a framework which supports developers in modeling smart things as web resources, exposing them through RESTful Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and developing applications on top of them. The framework consists of a Web Resource information model, a middleware, and tools for developing and publishing smart things’ digital representations on the Web. We discuss the framework compliance with REST guidelines and its major implementation choices. Finally, we report on our test activities carried out within the SmartSantander European Project to evaluate the use and proﬁciency of our framework in a smart city scenario.},

  abstract = {REST architectural style has become a prevalent choice for distributed resources, such as the northbound API of software-deﬁned networking (SDN). As services often undergo frequent changes and updates, the corresponding REST APIs need to change and update accordingly. To allow REST APIs to change and evolve without breaking its clients, a REST API can be designed to facilitate hypertext-driven navigation and its related mechanisms to deal with structure changes in the API. This paper addresses the issues in hypertext-driven navigation in REST APIs from three aspects. First, we present REST Chart, a PetriNet-based REST service description framework and language to design extensible REST APIs, and it is applied to cope with the rapid evolution of SDN northbound APIs. Second, we describe some important design patterns, such as backtracking and generator, within the REST Chart framework to navigate through large scale APIs in the RESTful architecture. Third, we present a client side differential cache mechanism to reduce the overhead of hypertext-driven navigation, addressing a major issue that affects the application of REST API. The proposed approach is applied to applications in SDN, which is integrated with a generalized SDN controller, SOX. The beneﬁts of the proposed approach are veriﬁed in different conditions. Experimental results on SDN applications show that on average, the proposed cache mechanism reduces the overhead of using the hypertext-driven REST API by 66\%, while fully maintaining the desired ﬂexibility and extensibility of the REST API.},

  shorttitle = {Design and {{Describe REST API}} without {{Violating REST}}},
  abstract = {As REST architectural style gains popularity in the web service community, there is a growing concern and debate on how to design RESTful web services (REST API) in a proper way. We attribute this problem to lack of a standard model and language to describe a REST API that respects all the REST constraints. As a result, many web services that claim to be REST API are not hypermedia driven as prescribed by REST. This situation may lead to REST APIs that are not as scalable, extensible, and interoperable as promised by REST. To address this issue, this paper proposes REST Chart as a model and language to design and describe REST API without violating the REST constraints. REST Chart models a REST API as a special type of Colored Petri Net whose topology defines the REST API and whose token markings define the representational state space of user agents using that API. We demonstrate REST Chart with an example REST API. We also show how REST Chart can support efficient content negotiation and reuse hybrid representations to broaden design choices. Furthermore, we argue that the REST constraints, such as hypermedia driven and statelessness, can either be enforced naturally or checked automatically in REST Chart.},

Particularly important among those risks are failures to effectively address quality attribute requirements such as security, reliability, and performance. An architecture evaluation early in the software life cycle can identify and help mitigate those risks. In this paper we present guidelines to assist architecture evaluation activities in REST-based systems. These guidelines can be systematically used in conjunction with scenario-based evaluation methods to reason about design considerations and trade-offs. This paper also presents a proof of concept to describe how to use the guidelines in the context of an Architecture Trade-off Analysis Method (ATAM) evaluation.},

Nevertheless, many existing REST APIs are known to be not well-designed, resulting in the absence of desirable quality attributes that truly RESTful systems entail. Although existing analysis show, that many REST APIs are not fully REST compliant, it is still an open issue how to improve this deficit and where to start. In this work, we introduce a framework for the structural analysis of REST APIs based on their description documents, as this allows for a comprehensive, well-structured analysis approach that also includes analyzing the corresponding API description languages. A first validation builds on a set of 286 real world API descriptions available as Swagger documents, and comprises their transformation into a canonical metamodel for REST APIs as well as a metrics-based analysis and discussion of their structural characteristics with respect to compliance with the REST architectural style.},

  abstract = {Fraktur (German: [fʁakˈtuːɐ̯] (listen)) is a calligraphic hand of the Latin alphabet and any of several blackletter typefaces derived from this hand. The blackletter lines are broken up; that is, their forms contain many angles when compared to the smooth curves of the Antiqua (common) typefaces modeled after antique Roman square capitals and Carolingian minuscule. From this, Fraktur is sometimes contrasted with the "Latin alphabet" in northern European texts, which is sometimes called the "German alphabet", simply being a typeface of the Latin alphabet. Similarly, the term "Fraktur" or "Gothic" is sometimes applied to all of the blackletter typefaces (known in German as Gebrochene Schrift, "Broken Script").
Here is the English alphabet in Fraktur:

  abstract = {Mobile application developers, aimming to make their applications available to the largest number of platforms, are increasingly seeking to optimize how to develop mobile applications. Creating the same specific application for each platform demands greater financial, time and labor investment. In order to reduce these problems, mobile development frameworks for multiplatforms have emerged, making possible to create multi-platform applications from the same source code. However, a new issue arises for the developer - the plurality and diversity of these frameworks, each one with objectives and characteristics that sometimes make them closer and in other cases farther. In addition, there is a demand for multi-purpose applications and work teams with different training profiles. For these reasons, choosing a framework is not trivial. This paper presents an approach that indicates which multi-platform application development framework is most suitable for a given project, implemented as a knowledge-based recommendation system that considered the critical factors of a given project.},

Be sure to ask for help in the comments if you need any. Suggestions for future Flutter tutorials are also very welcome! :)

Flutter is an SDK owned by Google to create applications for Android and iOS using a single codebase. Flutter uses the Dart programming language (also owned by Google). Flutter was in beta when I released this video, so things might still change a bit. But the SDK is already mature enough to write some cool production apps!

  abstract = {This analysis proposes a decision tree for selecting cross-device communication technologies for iOS and Android mobile devices. This tree accelerates the selection of cross-device technologies by taking into account known use cases of interaction. Five different communication technologies were tested (Real-time Multiplayer, Nearby Messages, PeerJS, iBeacon and Eddystone) by means of 13 proof of concept applications distributed between both operating systems (Android-iOS, iOS-iOS, Android-Android) and the design of 20 architecture diagrams of three types: sequence (connection to services and message sending), deployment and component. The decision tree was validated by mobile development experts resulting in a maximum reduction of up to 30 days of technology selection research. The effectiveness of the tree as a tool is 60\%, its usefulness 80\% and its ease of comprehension 90\%, according to the results obtained from the experts.},

  abstract = {The current trends towards globalisation, together with the exponential growth of the number of mobile devices led the markets to a boom in the demand for the development of mobile applications. Moreover, with the expansion and heterogeneity of the mobile devices and platforms, software companies need to search for faster and cheaper ways to develop applications that are able to span as many devices as possible in order to capture the market. Currently, Android and iOS Operating Systems roughly share and dominate the mobile market, with timid expressions of other competitors. Each of these mobile operating systems was developed using their own languages and strategy and offer SDKs for development of applications using their libraries - known as native apps. On the other hand, the evolution of HTML5, CSS and JavaScript created generic alternatives to create mobile apps that run on devices on all operating systems, however lacking some capabilities to access the device's full potential. Alongside came the novel hybrid cross-platform development frameworks, which try to take the best of both worlds. Native versus hybrid platforms the trend in mobile app development using hybrid platforms and their advantage. It would not be great with just one language to develop mobile applications for all mobile devices?},

By using this technology, Learning Management System (LMS) can provide an unimpeded interaction for their users and promote awareness for any information updates. It is crucial to develop mobile application for each major mobile platform to reach most of the LMS user. In this paper, the mobile application development was done by combining native mobile technology and web technology using WebView API. This approach was taken to anticipate the need for creating and maintaining the application on multiple mobile platform and was expected to cut development time frame while retaining consistent interface and still enable platform specific's feature usage. The purpose of this study is to review the strengths and weaknesses of such combination in mobile application development specifically under android platform.},
