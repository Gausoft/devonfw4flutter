## The Goal of this Guide
This guide aims to bridge the gap between the absolute [Flutter (Flutter Dev Team 2018a)](https://flutter.dev/) basics and clean, structured Flutter development. It should bring you from the basics of knowing how to build an app with Flutter to an understanding of how to do it properly. Or at least show you one possible way to do it properly.

## Who is this Guide for?
For people with a basic knowledge of the Flutter Framework. I recommend following this [tutorial by the Flutter team (Flutter Dev Team 2018b)](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab). It will walk you through developing your first flutter application. You should also have a basic understanding of the [Dart (Google LLC 2019a)](https://dart.dev/) programming language. No worries, it is very similar to Java, Kotlin and JavaScript. So if you know 1 or 2 of those languages you should be fine. Lastly, for the Architecture chapter, you should have a basic understanding of  [Data Streams (Google LLC 2019b)](https://dart.dev/tutorials/language/streams).

## Topics that will be covered 
- A recommendation for one possible Flutter-Development-Setup
- A brief introduction to the Flutter Framework in general. How it work _under the hood_ and it's underlying structure.
- One possible architecture for your Flutter app and how to implement it ([BLoC (Soares 2018)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLHln7wHgPE))
- How to test your app
- Some conventions and best practices for Dart, BLoC and the Flutter Framework
- My personal opinion of the framework

## Creation Context
This Guide was written by a student in the Bachelor of Science Program “Computer Science and Media Technology” at [Technical University Cologne (Technical University Cologne 2019)](https://www.th-koeln.de/en/homepage_26.php). It was created for one of the modules in that Bachelor. In addition to this, the Guide was written in collaboration with [Capgemini Cologne (Capgemini 2019)](https://www.capgemini.com/us-en/). Capgemini released a [Guide on building an application in Angular (Ambuludi, Linares, and Contributors 2019)](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4ng) in May of 2019, this Guide is mend to be the the flutter version of that.

## Structure of the Guide
The Guide is designed to be read in order, from Chapter 0 (this one) to Chapter 6. Code examples throughout the chapters will manly be take from [Wisgen (Faust 2019)](https://github.com/Fasust/wisgen), an example Flutter Application that was specifically built for the purposes of this Guide.
