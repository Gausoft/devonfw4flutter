# Introduction
## The Goal of this Guide
This guide aims to bridge the gap between the absolute flutter basics and clean, structured flutter development. 

## Who is this Guide for?
People with a basic knowledge of the Flutter Framework. I recommend following this tutorial by the Flutter team. It will walk you through developing your first flutter application. You should also have a basic understanding of the Dart programming language. No worries, it is very similar to Java, Kotlin and JavaScript. So if you know 1 or 2 of thous languages, you should be fine. Lastly, for the Architecture chapter, you should have a basic understanding of  _Data Streams_.

## Topics that will be covered 
- A recommendation for a Flutter - Development Setup
