## Introduction
If you come from the native mobile world and _imperative_ frameworks like IOS and Android, developing with Flutter can take while to get used to. Flutter, other then those frameworks mentioned above, is a _declarative_ Framework. 

## Declarative vs Imperative
But what exactly is the difference between _declarative_ and _imperative_? I will try to explain this using a metaphor: For a second, Let's think of programming as _talking_ to the underlying framework. In this context, an imperative approach is telling the framework **exactly** what you want it to do. "Imperium" (Latin) means "to command". A declarative approach, on the other hand, would be describing to the framework what kind of result you want to get and letting the framework decide on how to achieve that result. "Declaro" (Latin) means "to explain". Let's look at an example:

```dart
List numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]
for(int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++){
    if(numbers[i] > 3 ) print(numbers[i]);     
}
```
_Code Snippet 1: Number List (Imperative)_

Here we want to print every entry in the list that is bigger then 3. We explicitly tell the framework to go through the List one by one and check each value. In the declarative version, we simply state how our result should look like, but not how to reach it:

```dart
List numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]
print(numbers.where((num) => num > 3));
```
_Code Snippet 2: Number List (Declarative)_

One Important thing to note here is, that the difference between Imperative and Declarative is not black and white. One style might bleed over into the other. Prof. David Brailsford from the University of Nottingham argues that as soon as you start using libraries for you imperative projects, they become a tiny bit mor declarative.

## Declarative Flutter
Okay, now that we understand what a declarative means, let's take a look at Flutter specifically. This is a quote from Flutters official documentation:

> "Flutter is declarative. This means that Flutter builds its user interface to reflect the current state of your app" [(Flutter Dev Team 2019)](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/declarative)

![UI = f(State)](https://github.com/Fasust/flutter-guide/wiki//.images/ui-equals-function-of-state.png)

_Figure 1: [UI = f(State) (Flutter Dev Team 2019)](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/declarative)_

This means that you never imperatively or explicitly call an UI element to change it. You rather _declare_ that the UI should look a certain way, given a certain _state_. For Example, let's say we want to build a button that changes it's color to red when it is pressed. In an imperative framework like Android, we find the button by it's ID, attach a listener and tell that listener to change the background color when the button is clicked:

```java
Button button = findViewById(R.id.button_id);
button.setBackground(blue);
boolean pressed = false;

button.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() { 
    @Override
    public void onClick(View view) 
    { 
        button.setBackground(pressed ? red : blue);
    } 
}); 
```
_Code Snippet 3: Red button in Android (Imperative)_

In Flutter on the other hand, we never call the UI element directly, we instead declare that the button background should be red or blue depending on the App-Sate (here the bool "pressed"). We then declare that the onPressed function should update the app state and re-build the button:

```dart
bool pressed = false;

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FlatButton(
        color: pressed ? Colors.red : Colors.blue,
        onPressed: () {
            setState(){ // trigger re-build of the button
                pressed = !pressed;
            } 
        }
    );
}
```

## Efficiency 
Is it not very inefficient to re-render the entire Widget every time we change the state? That was the first questions I had when learning about this topic. But I was pleased to learn, that Flutter uses something called "RenderObjects" to improve performance. 
> "RenderObjects persist between frames and Flutterâ€™s lightweight Widgets tell the framework to mutate the RenderObjects between states. The Flutter framework handles the rest."
