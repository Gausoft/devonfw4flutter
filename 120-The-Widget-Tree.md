## Introduction
This section will give you a better understanding of how programming in [Flutter (Flutter Dev Team 2018)](https://flutter.dev/) actually works. You will learn how a Declarative framework like Flutter differs form an Imperative Framework like Android or IOS. And lastly, you will be introduced to two of the most central topics of Flutter: The [_Widget Tree_ (Flutter Dev Team 2019)](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets-intro) and [_Sate_ (Flutter Dev Team 2019)](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt).

## Thinking Declaratively
- Declecraive vs. Imperative
  
## The Widget Tree
- the tree
- Buildcontext
- Widgets in General
  - Imutable
  - Each widget does one specific thing

### Stateless Widgets
#### Lifecycle
### Stateful Widgets
- what is state 
  - mutable
  - "n properties that change over time"
  - long life span
  - sticks around
- why 2 party
#### Lifecycle

## When to use Stateful/Stateful Widgets

## How to access State
- Lifting up
- Inherited Widget
- 2 types of state
  - local and global
  - more in architecture
