## The Goal of this Guide
This guide aims to bridge the gap between the absolute Flutter [@flutterdevteamFlutterFramework2018] basics and clean, structured Flutter development. It should bring you from the basics of knowing how to build an app with Flutter to an understanding of how to do it _properly_. Or at least show you one possible way to make large scale Flutter projects clean and manageable.

## Who is this Guide for?
For people with a basic knowledge of the Flutter Framework. I recommend following this Flutter team [@flutterdevteamWriteYourFirst2018]. It will walk you through developing your first flutter application. You should also have a basic understanding of the Dart programming language [@dartteamDartProgrammingLanguage2019]. No worries, it is very similar to Java [@oracleJavaJDK1996], Kotlin [@jetbrainsKotlinSDK2017] and JavaScript [@ecmaJavaScriptECMAStandard1997]. So if you know 1 or 2 of those languages you should be fine. Lastly, for the Architecture chapter, you should have a basic understanding of Data Streams [@dartteamDartStreams2019].

## Topics that will be covered 
- A brief introduction to the Flutter Framework in general. How it works _under the hood_ and its underlying structure.
- One possible architecture for your Flutter app and how to implement it (BLoC [@soaresFlutterAngularDartCode2018])
- How to test your app
- Some conventions and best practices for Dart, BLoC and the Flutter Framework
- My personal opinion of the framework
