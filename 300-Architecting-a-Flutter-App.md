# What options are there? 
  - Vanilla, Redux, Bloc, Provide/Scoped Model
  - Which one will I focus on and Why?
  - Google went bach and forth on this as well.

# Provider Package 
  - UI only publishes and subscribes
  - Every UI element that has logic, has a dedicated logic class
  - Global services are provided on root
  - Only one possible option. This one has the smallest overhead and is a great start for beginners.
  - Bloc would be my second choice
